    A world-renowned Indian dish, biryani takes time and practice to make but is worth every bit of the effort.
    Long-grained rice (like basmati) flavored with fragrant spices such as saffron and layered with lamb, chicken, fish,
    or vegetables and a thick gravy.
    The dish is then covered, its lid secured with dough,
    and then the biryani is cooked over a low flame.
    This is definitely a special occasion dish.
